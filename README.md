# UFO Sightings
## Overview of Project:

In UFO Sightings projects we are playing Dana who creates a webpage and dynamic table and add more filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape so that users can filter for multiple criteria at same time.

## Analysis:
Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. She builds two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

The modified UFO sightings website consists of dynamic table with filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary:

D3 is a JavaScript library that produces sophisticated and highly dynamic graphics in an HTML webpage enabling it to "listen" for events, such as a user clicking a button. Having a separate D3.js, app.js abd data.js keeps it clean. CSS allows customizing making it visually appealing and being able to configure to user needs.
